# LesA_model
Prediction model of LesA structure (Q87AW0)

Description of repository files:

LesA-phyremodel.pse
The enzyme structure was built using Phyre2 server based on the structure of a known enzyme homologous of X. fastidiosa: LipA from X. oryzae (3H2I). 
382 residues (99% of amino acid sequence from the protein) have been modelized with 100% confidence and 68% of identity. 
The 3 amino-acids of the catalytic triad are colored in magenta (selection cat_triad).
The hydrolase part of the protein is colored in pink, while the lid domain (enzymatic pocket) is colored in green.
