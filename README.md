# LesA_model
## Prediction model of LesA structure (Q87AW0)
Author : Nicolas Favelin

Description of repository files:

* LesA-phyremodel.pse (compatible with PyMol)

  The enzyme structure was built using Phyre2 server based on the structure of a known enzyme homologous of X. fastidiosa: LipA from X. oryzae (3H2I). 
  382 residues (99% of amino acid sequence from the protein) have been modelized with 100% confidence and 68% of identity. 
  The 3 amino-acids of the catalytic triad are colored in magenta (selection cat_triad).
  The hydrolase part of the protein is colored in pink, while the lid domain (enzymatic pocket) is colored in green.

* LesA-phyre.ezm (compatible with Ezmol)
  
  For online vizualisation: http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/ezmol/
  
  The 3 amino-acids of the catalytic triad are colored in red.
  The hydrolase part of the protein is colored in pink, while the lid domain (enzymatic pocket) is colored in green.

* LesA-phyre.pdb
  
  Can be opened with any molecular visualisation software (Pymol, VMD, Chimera, etc...)
  
* pocket-LesA-phyre.pse (compatible with PyMol)
  
  Representation of enzymatic pocket of LesA. 
  The 3 amino-acids of the catalytic triad are colored in magenta (selection cat_triad). The mesh and surface representations allow to visualize the inside of the pocket.
